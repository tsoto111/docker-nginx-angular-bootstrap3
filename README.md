# Docker + Nginx + Angular + Bootstrap 3

This is a base starter docker configuration for an NGINX + Angular + Bootstrap3 environment for simple
training projects.

## Tools
These are the tools that are installed manually into the nginx image via the Dockerfile.

* **Nginx** - The base server we are using within the docker container. We always install the latest version of Nginx via the official Docker distro via DockerHub.
* **Node JS** - Node package manager we use to install Angular CLI with.
* **Angular CLI** - The "command line interface" we use to install a fresh install of Angular into this project's app directory documented below.
* **Bootstrap 3** - Used in training course for quick styling of html elements.


## Install Angular App
To install a fresh Angular app, we will used the pre-installed `angular-cli` tool within the web container.

1. Make sure `docker compose` is running for the project. All you have to do is run the following script within the root directory of the project.

    ```
    docker compose up
    ```

2. Once docker as built the project and installed all of the required dependencies for the first time, you can install a fresh Angular project in the following way. Open a bash console within the running docker container.

    ```
    docker compose exec web bash -l
    ```

3. Once you have entered the container's bash console, run the following script using the pre-installed `angular-cli`.

    ```
    ng new <my-app-name>
    ```

    where `<my-app-name>` is the desired project name.

4. After you have installed the Angular project and filled out all of the script's prompts, you should be able to start serving your angular app within the container by running:

    ```
    ng serve --poll 2000
    ```

5. From there, you should be able to open your freshly installed Angular app by opening `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Run your Angular App

If you already have an angular app installed in this project's `app` directory, then all you need to do is run your app. You can do this using the following steps.

1. Make sure you have your project container running by calling the following terminal script in the root project directory.

   ```
   docker compose up
   ```

2. Once your project conainer is running, you need to enter the running container with the following script.

    ```
    docker compose exec web bash -l
    ```

3. Once you have entered the running container, enter the project directory and start angular with the following scripts.

   ```
   cd <my-app-name>
   ng serve --poll 2000
   ```
   **Note:** Documentation over the `--poll` flag can be found in the following StackOverflow post "[What is the function of --poll flag in CLI](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51930195/what-is-the-function-of-poll-flag-in-cli#answer-51930293)."

4. Once Angular CLI has started the Angular app, you should be able to pull your angular project up in the browser via `http://localhost:8080`.
